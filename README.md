# Argon Voice & Video Platform - Master Repository

Welcome to the **Argon Voice & Video Platform** master repository!     
This repository serves as the central hub for all the information related to our platform, offering voice and video communication solutions that are scalable, reliable, and high-quality.

## Overview
Argon is a distributed, self-hosted platform for voice and video communications, designed to be easily scalable for businesses of all sizes. Whether you're interested in contributing to the code, deploying your own instance, or just staying informed about our progress, you've come to the right place!

This master repository is intended to help you navigate through the Argon platform's development, features, and issue tracking.     
Here, you'll find details about the overall system, contributions, and the relationships between the different components.    

## Repositories
The Argon platform is organized into several repositories, each dedicated to a key part of the project:

1. **[server](https://github.com/argon-chat/server)**: Contains the entire backend, including the server-side logic, communication protocols, and integration layers. This is where the core functionality of the Argon platform resides, making sure that every call, stream, and message is handled seamlessly. The server is licensed under the **Business Source License 1.1**. See [server LICENSE](https://github.com/argon-chat/server/blob/master/LICENSE) for more details.

2. **[client](https://github.com/argon-chat/client)**: Includes the host application along with the Vue-based frontend. This repository covers everything related to the user interface and experience, ensuring intuitive navigation, clean UI design, and real-time features for users. The client is licensed under the **GPL-2.0 license**. See [client LICENSE](https://github.com/argon-chat/client/blob/master/LICENSE) for more details.

3. **[infra](https://github.com/argon-chat/infra)**: Contains infrastructure-related scripts, such as CI/CD workflows, deployment configurations, and Docker images. This repository is responsible for automation, helping us deploy updates and scale the platform efficiently. (Currently is a private repo)

4. **[server-ee](https://github.com/argon-chat/server-ee)**: Contains enterprice\global-related code, including grains related to security, payment systems, and paid features. (Currently is a private repo)
